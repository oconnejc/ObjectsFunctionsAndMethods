#
# done: 2.
#   READ this comment, ASKING QUESTIONS as needed to understand it.
#
#   For objects that are CONSTRUCTED, we use the DOT notation
#   to ask them to do things or to change their characteristics.
#   For example:
#      nadia = rg.SimpleTurtle()
#      nadia.pen = rg.Pen('blue', 1)
#      nadia.forward(100)
#
#   In the above example:
#
#      pen      is an   INSTANCE VARIABLE   (aka DATA ATTRIBUTE, FIELD)
#                 of SimpleTurtles.  It is a CHARACTERISTIC of
#                 SimpleTurtles. Each SimpleTurtle has its own VALUE
#                 of that characteristic.
#
#      forward  is a   METHOD   (aka FUNCTION ATTRIBUTE)
#                 of SimpleTurtles.  It is something that any
#                 SimpleTurtle can DO.  It is just like a FUNCTION
#                 except for details about the way that it is called.
#
#   The statement
#        nadia.forward(100)
#   CALLS the   forward   METHOD on nadia, sending that method the number 100 and making the method run (execute).
#
#   We   ** define **   FUNCTIONS to give NAMES to blocks of code (note FUNCTIONS and METHODS are different).
#   For example:
#
#      def turtle3():
#          maja = rg.SimpleTurtle()
#          maja.pen = rg.Pen('green', 10)
#          maja.paint_bucket = rg.PaintBucket('black')
#            ...
#
#   We   ** call **   FUNCTIONS (that is, we make them run) in a way that is similar to how we call METHODS,
#   but WITHOUT the DOT notation.  For example
#      def main():
#          turtle3()
#
#   Run this module and review the existing code.  Can you identify the functions calls and methods calls?
#
#   When you believe you understand the differences and similarities
#   between calling a FUNCTION and calling a METHOD, change the above TO DO to DONE.
